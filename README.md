Local File Share
A simple Flask-based file-sharing web app that allows users connected to the same Wi-Fi network to upload and download files. Users can set an expiration time for their files, after which they are automatically deleted.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Upload and download any file (images, PDFs, ZIPs, text files, etc.).
âœ… Files are accessible to all devices on the same Wi-Fi network.
âœ… Choose how long a file remains available (5 min, 10 min, 1 hour, 10 hours, 24 hours).
âœ… Clean and responsive UI for both mobile and desktop.
